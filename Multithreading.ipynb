    "1.Multithreading allows concurrent execution of tasks, making applications more responsive, especially in user interface scenarios.\n",

    "3.Well-suited for I/O-bound tasks where threads can perform other operations while waiting for input/output operations to complete.\n",

    "2.Multithreading introduces complexity due to the need for synchronization mechanisms (e.g., locks, semaphores) to avoid data race conditions and ensure proper communication between threads.\n",
    "3.Debugging multithreaded programs can be challenging, as issues like deadlocks and race conditions may occur, and the behavior can be non-deterministic. \n",
